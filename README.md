# autohotkeyfordvorakkeyboard

This is for people who use dvorak on windows machines. The copy and paste functions are shifted to the right side of the keyboard due 
to the different layout. This autohotkey script remaps the basic functions of copy, paste, cut, undo so that you can call upon these
functions with your left hand while keeping your right hand on the mouse.
